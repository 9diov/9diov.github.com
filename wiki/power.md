# Power

**Power** is the ability to influence the external world in some way.

Power is correlated with [Truth](/wiki/truth). The higher the ability to
accurately model the external world, the more power one could have.

Power is correlated with [Option](/wiki/option). Generally speaking, one who
have more options has more power. Example: the queen is the most powerful chess piece on the chess board due to the amount of options it has at each turn.

Power is Steve Pavlina's [3rd primary principle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3074052-personal-development-for-smart-people).
