# Role

**Role** is the set of behaviors associated with an identity which a person uses unconsciously. Examples of roles are "father", "teacher", "guardian", "protector", etc.

For example, in Kim Lan's "Vo nhat", Trang, once married has a new role - the role of "husband". The new role made him see the world differently and changed his behavior.

Role is used as a [mental shortcut](/wiki/mental_shortcut) to behave and make fast decision. Quote from [HPMOR](http://www.hpmor.com/): People don't think, they just play roles.
