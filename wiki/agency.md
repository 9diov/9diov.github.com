Agency is the ability to take actions which one's beliefs indicate would lead to the accomplishment of one's goals.

Humans seem to have low levels of agency, rarely ensuring accurate beliefs, rarely thinking about problems (as opposed to relying on cached answers), and rarely doing things other than what they happened to do in the past.
